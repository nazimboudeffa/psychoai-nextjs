Now recall our discussions concerning the \nimportance of the role of external or internal bodily stimuli as \ndisturbers of sleep, or as dream producers. We learned definite \nfacts about this, but could only explain a very small number \nof dreams in this way. In these children's dreams nothing \npoints to the influence of such somatic stimuli; we cannot be \nmistaken, for the dreams are entirely intelligible and easy to \nsurvey.
